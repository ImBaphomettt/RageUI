Dear developer,

I wish to announce this final message to all users of my library. First of all, I want to express my gratitude to all the people who contributed to the development of this library. Unfortunately, I must inform you that it will no longer receive updates or additional content. Although I appreciate your support, I no longer find the pleasure I experienced during the creation of this open-source project.

The development community has changed significantly and no longer aligns with my ambitions for the platform. Since the commercialization of scripts, the way of contributing to a platform that was once very close to its community of developers has radically changed. Now, there are multiple paid resources, between $10 and $20, for simple rage menus that call 2 GTA natives. I consider this to be theft, given that people are earning money by using our work, while these mediocre things are mainly a simple menu with options without any real work behind them.

To answer many questions, yes, you can use this library for commercial purposes. Anyway, many people have not waited for my permission to do so.

I want to thank everyone who helped create this reputation through their contributions or aggressive use of OUR work. I wish you all the best in the FiveM development community.

Sincerely Baphomet (iTexZoz).
